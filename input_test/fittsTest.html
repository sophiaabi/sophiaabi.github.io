<h1> Fitts Law Study: Pointer Finger vs Pinkie Finger</h1>

<h4>Authors: Sophia AbiEzzi and Ally Arenson</h4>

<p>We used GoFitts to test the difference in performance of using a pointer finger vs pinkie finger on a Mac trackpad. We conducted 9 rounds of 9 clicks per trial for each case, and had 2 people perform the tests (Ally and Sophia), resulting in a total of 162 data points for each test case. We made sure to be in the same sitting position while we conducted the test to ensure a controlled environemnt. As for test settings, we set the amplitudes at 100, 200, and 300, set the widths at 20, 40, and 80, and had an error threshold of 50%.</p><br>

<p>Hypothesis: Before starting the experiment, we believe navigating and clicking with the pointer finger on the trackpad will result in a higher throughput than the pinkie finger.</p>

<h2> Analysis </h2>
<p>After analyzing the data one can see that the pointer finger has a faster performance than the pinky finger. The bar chart above shows that on average the pointer finger has a faster throughput value of 4.34 bits/s, compared to the average pinky finger throughput value of 3.51 bits/s.</p>
